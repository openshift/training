# Installation and Scheduler
Much like with OpenShift Enterprise 2.x and prior, we provide a convenient
web-sourced installer at `http://install.openshift.com`. First, we must prepare
for using the installer.

## Generate SSH Keys
The installer uses ssh underneath the covers to access the hosts in the
environment and configure them. To do this without passwords, we require that
SSH keys be generated and distributed. The standaard tool to do this is
`ssh-keygen`. You can run it with no arguments:

    ssh-keygen

Do *not* use a password when prompted.

## Distribute SSH Keys
An easy way to distribute your SSH keys is by using a `bash` loop:

    for host in ose3-master.example.com ose3-node1.example.com \
    ose3-node2.example.com; do ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
    $host; done

Remember, if your FQDNs are different, you would have to modify the command
accordingly.

## Run the Installer
As `root` in `/root`, go ahead and run the installer:

    atomic-openshift-installer -a openshift-ansible/

You will see:

    Welcome to the OpenShift Enterprise 3 installation.
    
    Please confirm that following prerequisites have been met:
    
    * All systems where OpenShift will be installed are running Red Hat Enterprise
      Linux 7.
    * All systems are properly subscribed to the required OpenShift Enterprise 3
      repositories.
    * All systems have run docker-storage-setup (part of the Red Hat docker RPM).
    * All systems have working DNS that resolves not only from the perspective of
      the installer but also from within the cluster.
    
    When the process completes you will have a default configuration for Masters
    and Nodes.  For ongoing environment maintenance it's recommended that the
    official Ansible playbooks be used.
    
    For more information on installation prerequisites please see:
    https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/latest/admin_guide/install/prerequisites.html
    
    Are you ready to continue? [y/N]: 

Press `y` to continue and hit enter.

## Define installation user
The installer supports operation as non-root, but, for this training, we will
use root. We have already distributed our ssh keys as root. You will see a
prompt like:

    This installation process will involve connecting to remote hosts via ssh.  Any
    account may be used however if a non-root account is used it must have
    passwordless sudo access.
    
    User for ssh access [root]: 

Hit enter to conintue.

## Host Configuration
The next step will be to select which hosts to have the installer configure. You
should enter the information as follows below:

    ***Host Configuration***
    
    The OpenShift Master serves the API and web console.  It also coordinates the
    jobs that have to run across the environment.  It can even run the datastore.
    For wizard based installations the database will be embedded.  It's possible to
    change this later using etcd from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
    
    Any Masters configured as part of this installation process will also be
    configured as Nodes.  This is so that the Master will be able to proxy to Pods
    from the API.  By default this Node will be unscheduleable but this can be changed
    after installation with 'oadm manage-node'.
    
    The OpenShift Node provides the runtime environments for containers.  It will
    host the required services to be managed by the Master.
    
    http://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/latest/architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master
    http://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/latest/architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#node
        
    Enter hostname or IP address: []: ose3-master.example.com
    Will this host be an OpenShift Master? [y/N]: y
    Do you want to add additional hosts? [y/N]: y
    Enter hostname or IP address: []: ose3-node1.example.com
    Will this host be an OpenShift Master? [y/N]: n
    Do you want to add additional hosts? [y/N]: y
    Enter hostname or IP address: []: ose3-node2.example.com
    Will this host be an OpenShift Master? [y/N]: n
    Do you want to add additional hosts? [y/N]: n

## Variant Selection
We will be installing OpenShift Enterprise 3.1, so be sure to select *2*:

    Which variant would you like to install?


    (1) OpenShift Enterprise 3.0
    (2) OpenShift Enterprise 3.1
    (3) Atomic OpenShift Enterprise 3.1
    Choose a variant from above:  [1]: 2

## Gathering host information:
At this point the installer will log-in to each of the hosts to get information:

    Gathering information from hosts...

## General Confirmation
The installer will now show you an overview of the installation details. You
should see something like the following:

    A list of the facts gathered from the provided hosts follows. Because it is
    often the case that the hostname for a system inside the cluster is different
    from the hostname that is resolveable from command line or web clients
    these settings cannot be validated automatically.
    
    For some cloud providers the installer is able to gather metadata exposed in
    the instance so reasonable defaults will be provided.
    
    Plese confirm that they are correct before moving forward.
    
    
    192.168.133.2,192.168.133.2,ose3-master.example.com,ose3-master.example.com
    192.168.133.3,192.168.133.3,ose3-node1.example.com,ose3-node1.example.com
    192.168.133.4,192.168.133.4,ose3-node2.example.com,ose3-node2.example.com
    
    Format:
    
    IP,public IP,hostname,public hostname
    
    Notes:
     * The installation host is the hostname from the installer's perspective.
     * The IP of the host should be the internal IP of the instance.
     * The public IP should be the externally accessible IP associated with the instance
     * The hostname should resolve to the internal IP from the instances
       themselves.
     * The public hostname should resolve to the external ip from hosts outside of
       the cloud.
    
    Do the above facts look correct? [y/N]: 

If you are installing in a cloud-like environment (AWS, OpenStack, etc), please
take special note of the *Notes* section, as it contains very important details
about how to change the final configuration to handle public vs private
resources and etc.

Select `y` and press enter to continue.

## Finish the Installation
You will now see something like the following:

    Ready to run installation process.
    
    If changes are needed to the values recorded by the installer please update /root/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml.
    
    Are you ready to continue? [y/N]: 

Type `y` and hit enter to begin the installation. You will then see the
installer do its work. At the end of the installation process, you should see
something like the following:

    PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************** 
    localhost                  : ok=10   changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0   
    ose3-master.example.com    : ok=185  changed=54   unreachable=0    failed=0   
    ose3-node1.example.com     : ok=52   changed=20   unreachable=0    failed=0   
    ose3-node2.example.com     : ok=52   changed=20   unreachable=0    failed=0   

    
    The installation was successful!
    
    If this is your first time installing please take a look at the Administrator
    Guide for advanced options related to routing, storage, authentication and much
    more:
    
    http://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/latest/admin_guide/overview.html
    
    Press any key to continue ...

Press any key to continue and exit the installer. You now have a working
OpenShift Enterprise environment!

## Add Cloud Domain
If you want default routes (we'll talk about these later) to automatically get
the right domain (the one you configured earlier with your wildcard DNS), then
you should edit `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` and edit the
following:

    routingConfig:
      subdomain: cloudapps.example.com

Or modify it appropriately for your domain.

# Regions and Zones
If you think you're about to learn how to configure regions and zones in
OpenShift 3, you're only partially correct.

In OpenShift 2, we introduced the specific concepts of "regions" and "zones" to
enable organizations to provide some topologies for application resiliency. Apps
would be spread throughout the zones in a region and, depending on the way you
configured OpenShift, you could make different regions accessible to users.

The reason that you're only "partially" correct in your assumption is that, for
OpenShift 3, Kubernetes doesn't actually care about your topology. In other
words, OpenShift is "topology agnostic". In fact, OpenShift 3 provides advanced
controls for implementing whatever topologies you can dream up, leveraging
filtering and affinity rules to ensure that parts of applications (pods) are
either grouped together or spread apart.

For the purposes of a simple example, we'll be sticking with the "regions" and
"zones" theme. But, as you go through these examples, think about what other
complex topologies you could implement. Perhaps "secure" and "insecure" hosts,
or other topologies.

First, we need to talk about the "scheduler" and its default configuration.

## Scheduler and Defaults
The "scheduler" is essentially the OpenShift master. Any time a pod needs to be
created (instantiated) somewhere, the master needs to figure out where to do
this. This is called "scheduling". The default configuration for the scheduler
looks like the following JSON (although this is embedded in the OpenShift code
and you won't find this in a file):

    {
      "predicates" : [
        {"name" : "PodFitsResources"},
        {"name" : "MatchNodeSelector"},
        {"name" : "HostName"},
        {"name" : "PodFitsPorts"},
        {"name" : "NoDiskConflict"}
      ],"priorities" : [
        {"name" : "LeastRequestedPriority", "weight" : 1},
        {"name" : "ServiceSpreadingPriority", "weight" : 1}
      ]
    }

When the scheduler tries to make a decision about pod placement, first it goes
through "predicates", which essentially filter out the possible nodes we can
choose. Note that, depending on your predicate configuration, you might end up
with no possible nodes to choose. This is totally OK (although generally not
desired).

These default options are documented in the link above, but the quick overview
is:

* Place pod on a node that has enough resources for it (duh)
* Place pod on a node that doesn't have a port conflict (duh)
* Place pod on a node that doesn't have a storage conflict (duh)

And some more obscure ones:

* Place pod on a node whose `NodeSelector` matches
* Place pod on a node whose hostname matches the `Host` attribute value

The next thing is, of the available nodes after the filters are applied, how do
we select the "best" one. This is where "priorities" come in. Long story short,
the various priority functions each get a score, multiplied by the weight, and
the node with the highest score is selected to host the pod.

Again, the defaults are:

* Choose the node that is "least requested" (the least busy)
* Spread services around - minimize the number of pods in the same service on
    the same node

And, for an extremely detailed explanation about what these various
configuration flags are doing, check out:

    https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/latest/admin_guide/scheduler.html

In a small environment, these defaults are pretty sane. Let's look at one of the
important predicates (filters) before we move on to "regions" and "zones".

## The NodeSelector
`NodeSelector` is a part of the Pod data model. And, if we think back to our pod
definition, there was a "label", which is just a key:value pair. In the case of
a `NodeSelector`, our labels (key:value pairs) are used to help us try to find
nodes that match, assuming that:

* The scheduler is configured to MatchNodeSelector
* The end user creating the pod knows which labels are out there

But this use case is also pretty simplistic. It doesn't really allow for a
topology, and there's not a lot of logic behind it. Also, if I specify a
NodeSelector label when using MatchNodeSelector and there are no matching nodes,
my workload will never get scheduled. Bummer.

How can we make this more intelligent? We'll finally use "regions" and "zones".

## Examining the Scheduler Configuration
The installer is configured to understand "regions" and "zones" as a matter of
convenience. However, for the master (scheduler) to actually do something with
them requires changing from the default configuration Take a look at
`/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` and find the line with
`schedulerConfigFile`.

You should see:

    schedulerConfigFile: "/etc/origin/master/scheduler.json"

Then, take a look at `/etc/origin/master/scheduler.json`. It will have the
following content:

    {
      "predicates": [
        {"name": "MatchNodeSelector"},
        {"name": "PodFitsResources"},
        {"name": "PodFitsPorts"},
        {"name": "NoDiskConflict"},
        {"name": "Region", "argument": {"serviceAffinity" : {"labels" : ["region"]}}}
      ],"priorities": [
        {"name": "LeastRequestedPriority", "weight": 1},
        {"name": "ServiceSpreadingPriority", "weight": 1},
        {"name": "Zone", "weight" : 2, "argument": {"serviceAntiAffinity" : {"label": "zone"}}}
      ]
    }

To quickly review the above (this explanation sort of assumes that you read the
scheduler documentation, but it's not critically important):

* Filter out nodes that don't fit the resources, don't have the ports, or have
    disk conflicts
* If the pod specifies a label with the key "region", filter nodes by the value.

So, if we have the following nodes and the following labels:

* Node 1 -- "region":"infra"
* Node 2 -- "region":"primary"
* Node 3 -- "region":"primary"

If we try to schedule a pod that has a `NodeSelector` of "region":"primary",
then only Node 2 and Node 3 would be considered.

OK, that takes care of the "region" part. What about the "zone" part?

Our priorities tell us to:

* Score the least-busy node higher
* Score any nodes who don't already have a pod in this service higher
* Score any nodes whose zone label's value **does not** match higher

Why do we score a zone that **doesn't** match higher? Note that the definition
for the Zone priority is a `serviceAntiAffinity` -- anti affinity. In this case,
our anti affinity rule helps to ensure that we try to get nodes from *different*
zones to take our pod.

If we consider that our "primary" region might be a certain datacenter, and that
each "zone" in that datacenter might be on its own power system with its own
dedicated networking, this would ensure that, within the datacenter, pods of an
application would be spread across power/network segments.

The documentation link has some more complicated examples. The topoligical
possibilities are endless!

## Node Labels
The assignments of "regions" and "zones" at the node-level are handled by labels
on the nodes. Since the installation process configured the regions and zones, but did not ask
us how to put the nodes into that topology, you need to label the nodes now:

    oc label node/ose3-master.example.com region=infra zone=default
    oc label node/ose3-node1.example.com region=primary zone=east
    oc label node/ose3-node2.example.com region=primary zone=west

You can look at how the labels were implemented by doing:

    oc get nodes

    NAME                      LABELS                                                                     STATUS                     AGE
    ose3-master.example.com   kubernetes.io/hostname=ose3-master.example.com,region=infra,zone=default   Ready,SchedulingDisabled   48m
    ose3-node1.example.com    kubernetes.io/hostname=ose3-node1.example.com,region=primary,zone=east     Ready                      48m
    ose3-node2.example.com    kubernetes.io/hostname=ose3-node2.example.com,region=primary,zone=west     Ready                      48m

At this point we have a running OpenShift environment across three hosts, with
one master and three nodes, divided up into two regions -- "*infra*structure"
and "primary". *BUT* the master is currently tagged as "SchedulingDisabled". The
installer will, by default, not configure the master's node to receive workload
(SchedulingDisabled). You will fix this in a moment.

## Edit Default NodeSelector
We want our apps to land in the primary region, and not in the infra region. We
can do this by setting a default `nodeSelector` for our OpenShift environment.
Edit the `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` again, and make the
following change:

    projectConfig:
      defaultNodeSelector: "region=primary"

Once complete, restart your master. This will make both our default
`nodeSelector` and routing changes take effect:

    systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master

## Make Master Schedulable
A single command can be used to make the master node schedulable:

    oadm manage-node ose3-master.example.com --schedulable=true

Then, run the following:

    oc get node

You should see that now your master is set to receive workloads:

    NAME                      LABELS                                                                     STATUS    AGE
    ose3-master.example.com   kubernetes.io/hostname=ose3-master.example.com,region=infra,zone=default   Ready     51m
    ose3-node1.example.com    kubernetes.io/hostname=ose3-node1.example.com,region=primary,zone=east     Ready     51m
    ose3-node2.example.com    kubernetes.io/hostname=ose3-node2.example.com,region=primary,zone=west     Ready     51m

## Tweak Default Project
The *default* project/namespace is a special one where we will put some of our
infrastructure-related resources. This project was created when OpenShift was
first started (OpenShift always ensures it exists).  We want resources deployed
into the *default* project to run on the *infra*structure nodes.

Since the *default* project was created when OpenShift was first started, it
didn't inherit any default `nodeSelector`. Further, we have configured a default
`nodeSelector` for *primary*, not the  *infra* region. So let's make a tweak so
that things that go in the *infra* region.

Execute the following:

    oc edit namespace default

In the annotations list, add this line:

    openshift.io/node-selector: region=infra

Save and exit the editor. Remember, indentation matters -- this entry should be
at the same indentation level as the rest of the `openshift.io` items.

From here we will start to deploy "applications" and other resources into
OpenShift.
