# DEPRECATED CONTENT
This content was originally designed for pre-release versions of OpenShift 3.
Since then, a lot has changed, and it has fallen into disrepair. If you are
interested in this content, we suggest you checkout the [Discovery
Center](https://github.com/openshift/discoverycenter) and consider contributing
there.

# OpenShift "Training"
This repository provides instructions for how to set up a basic OpenShift 3.X
environment. It contains various examples of using OpenShift 3.X. The table of
contents below provides links to the various chapters.

The material operates under an expectation of a fairly specific setup. If your
setup diverges significantly from this expected setup, you may need to make
significant modifications to the material.

**NOTE:** Currently OpenShift is at 3.0.1 and this material has not yet been
completely updated for it. Your mileage may vary. There are various dead links
and other paths-to-nowhere that are in the process of being updated/validated.
