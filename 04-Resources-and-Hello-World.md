# Your First Application
At this point you essentially have a sufficiently-functional V3 OpenShift
environment. It is now time to create the classic "Hello World" application
using some sample code.  But, first, some housekeeping.

Also, don't forget, the materials for these examples are in your
`~/training/content` folder.

## Resources
There are a number of different resource types in OpenShift 3, and, essentially,
going through the motions of creating/destroying apps, scaling, building and
etc. all ends up manipulating OpenShift and Kubernetes resources under the
covers. Resources can have quotas enforced against them, so let's take a moment
to look at some example JSON for project resource quota might look like:

    {
      "apiVersion": "v1",
      "kind": "ResourceQuota",
      "metadata": {
        "name": "test-quota"
      },
      "spec": {
        "hard": {
          "memory": "512Mi",
          "cpu": "500m",
          "pods": "3",
          "resourcequotas": "1"
        }
      }
    }

The above quota (simply called *test-quota*) defines limits for several
resources. In other words, within a project, users cannot "do stuff" that will
cause these resource limits to be exceeded. Since quota is enforced at the
project level, it is up to the users to allocate resources (more specifically,
memory and CPU) to their pods/containers. OpenShift will soon provide sensible
defaults.

* Memory

    The memory figure is in bytes, but various other suffixes are supported (eg:
    Mi (mebibytes), Gi (gibibytes), etc.

* CPU

    CPU is a little tricky to understand. The unit of measure is actually a
    "Kubernetes Compute Unit" (KCU, or "kookoo"). The KCU is a "normalized" unit
    that should be roughly equivalent to a single hyperthreaded CPU core.
    Fractional assignment is allowed. For fractional assignment, the
    **m**illicore may be used (eg: 200m = 0.2 KCU)

We will get into a description of what pods, services and replication
controllers are over the next few labs. Lastly, we can ignore "resourcequotas",
as it is a bit of a trick so that Kubernetes doesn't accidentally try to apply
two quotas to the same namespace.

## Applying Quota to Projects
At this point we have created our "demo" project, so let's apply the quota above
to it. Still in a `root` terminal on your master:

    oc create -f ~/training/content/quota.json -n demo

If you want to see that it was created:

    oc get -n demo quota
    NAME
    test-quota

And if you want to verify limits or examine usage:

    oc describe quota test-quota -n demo
    Name:           test-quota
    Namespace:      demo
    Resource        Used    Hard
    --------        ----    ----
    cpu             0       500m
    memory          0       512Mi
    pods            0       3
    resourcequotas  1       1

If you go back into the web console and click into the "OpenShift 3 Demo"
project, and click on the *Settings* tab, you'll see that the quota information
is displayed.

**Note:** Once creating the quota, it can take a few moments for it to be fully
processed. If you get blank output from the `get` or `describe` commands, wait a
few moments and try again.

## Applying Limit Ranges to Projects
In order for quotas to be effective you need to also create Limit Ranges
which set the maximum, minimum, and default allocations of memory and cpu at
both a pod and container level. Without default values for containers projects
with quotas will fail because the deployer and other infrastructure pods are
unbounded and therefore forbidden.

As `root`:

    oc create -f ~/training/content/limits.json -n demo

Review your limit ranges

    oc describe limitranges limits -n demo
    Name:           limits
    Namespace:      demo
    Type            Resource        Min     Max     Request Limit   Limit/Request
    ----            --------        ---     ---     ------- -----   -------------
    Pod             cpu             10m     500m    -       -       -
    Pod             memory          5Mi     750Mi   -       -       -
    Container       cpu             10m     500m    100m    100m    -
    Container       memory          5Mi     750Mi   100Mi   100Mi   -

The output at the moment is a little confusing, but the key points:

* If you don't specify a CPU or Memory limit, it will inherit the "Request", in
    this case 100m(illicores) or 100Mi(ebibytes), respectively.

* The "limit" is, in the absence of a specific request, the maximum value that
    is allowed to be consumed.

For more information on these details, you can look at the following section of
the documentation:

    https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/latest/dev_guide/quota.html

## Login
Since we have taken the time to create the *joe* user as well as a project for
him, we can log into a terminal as *joe* and then set up the command line
tooling.

First, as root, run:

    cp /etc/origin/master/ca.crt /home/joe/ca.crt

Open a terminal as `joe`:

    # su - joe

Then, execute:

    oc login -u joe \
    --certificate-authority=/home/joe/ca.crt \
    --server=https://ose3-master.example.com:8443

OpenShift, by default, is using a self-signed SSL certificate, so we must point
our tool at the CA file.

The `login` process created a file called named `~/.kube/config`
folder. Take a look at it, and you'll see something like the following:

    apiVersion: v1
    clusters:
    - cluster:
        certificate-authority: /etc/origin/master/ca.crt
        server: https://ose3-master.example.com:8443
      name: ose3-master-example-com:8443
    contexts:
    - context:
        cluster: ose3-master-example-com:8443
        namespace: demo
        user: joe/ose3-master-example-com:8443
      name: demo/ose3-master-example-com:8443/joe
    current-context: demo/ose3-master-example-com:8443/joe
    kind: Config
    preferences: {}
    users:
    - name: joe/ose3-master-example-com:8443
      user:
        token: iJv2XgeteuPe-WzuQ77j3LJzuuIeHo5aLR_bmTbollM

This configuration file has an authorization token, some information about where
our server lives, our project, etc.

## Grab the Training Repo Again
Since Joe and Alice can't access the training folder in root's home directory,
go ahead and grab it inside Joe's home folder:

    cd
    git clone https://github.com/openshift/training.git
    cd ~/training/content

## The Hello World Definition JSON
In the `training/content` folder, you can see a pod definition by using `cat`:

    cat hello-pod.json
    {
      "kind": "Pod",
      "apiVersion": "v1",
      "metadata": {
        "name": "hello-openshift",
        "creationTimestamp": null,
        "labels": {
          "name": "hello-openshift"
        }
      },
      "spec": {
        "containers": [
          {
            "name": "hello-openshift",
            "image": "openshift/hello-openshift:v1.0.6",
            "ports": [
              {
                "containerPort": 8080,
                "protocol": "TCP"
              }
            ],
            "resources": {
            },
            "terminationMessagePath": "/dev/termination-log",
            "imagePullPolicy": "IfNotPresent",
            "capabilities": {},
            "securityContext": {
              "capabilities": {},
              "privileged": false
            }
          }
        ],
        "restartPolicy": "Always",
        "dnsPolicy": "ClusterFirst",
        "serviceAccount": ""
      },
      "status": {}
    }

In the simplest sense, a *pod* is an instance of something. If you are familiar
with OpenShift V2 terminology, it is similar to a *gear*.  Reality is more
complex, and we will learn more about the terms as we explore OpenShift further.

## Create the Pod
As `joe`, to create the pod from our JSON file, execute the following:

    oc create -f ~/training/content/hello-pod.json

Remember, we've "logged in" to OpenShift and our project, so this will create
the pod inside of it. The command should display the ID of the pod:

    pod "hello-openshift" created

Issue a `get pods` to see the details of how it was defined:

    oc get pods
    NAME              READY     REASON    RESTARTS   AGE
    hello-openshift   1/1       Running   0          35s

To find out more information about this pod, use `describe`:

    oc describe pod hello-openshift                                                                                                                                                        [1/115]

On the node where the pod is running (`Host`), look at the list of Docker
containers with `docker ps` (in a `root` terminal) to see the bound ports.  We
should see an `openshift3/ose-pod` container bound to 36061 on the host and
bound to 8080 on the container, along with several other `ose-pod` containers.

    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                              COMMAND              CREATED              STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

The `openshift3/ose-pod` container exists because of the way network namespacing
works in Kubernetes. For the sake of simplicity, think of `ose-pod` as nothing
more than a way for the host OS to get an interface created for the
corresponding pod to be able to receive traffic. Deeper understanding of
networking in OpenShift is outside the scope of this material.

To verify that the app is working, you can issue a curl to the pod's port. This
should work from any node, because of the SDN (software defined network) that
OpenShift manages for you. Deeper details on the SDN is outside the scope of
this course.

    curl 10.1.1.2:8080
    Hello OpenShift!

Hooray!

*Note:* You'll need to use the correct IP address for your environment (as
shown in the `describe` output.

You'll also notice that the pod landed on one of the *primary* nodes. Why is that?
Because we had configured a default `nodeSelector` earlier during the set-up
process.

## Examining the Created Pod
Execute the following:

    oc get pod hello-openshift -o yaml

You should see something like:

There are some interesting things in here now. 

* We didn't specify a `nodeSelector` in our pod definition, but it's there now.
  * This is because OpenShift is configured with a default.
* We didn't specify any resource limits in our pod definition, but they're there
    now.
  * This is because our project has default limits set.

Cool, right?

## Looking at the Pod in the Web Console
Go to the web console and go to the *Overview* tab for the *OpenShift 3 Demo*
project. You'll see some interesting things:

* You'll see the pod is running (eventually)
* You'll see the image and container information for the pod
* You'll see the internal port that the pod's container's "application"/process
    is using
* You'll see that there's no service yet - we'll get to services soon.

## Quota Usage
If you click on the *Settings* tab, you'll see our pod usage has increased to 1.

You can also use `oc` to determine the current quota usage of your project. As
`joe`:

    oc describe quota test-quota

## Review
Take a moment to think about what this pod exercise really did -- it referenced
an arbitrary Docker image, made sure to fetch it (if it wasn't present), and
then ran it. This could have just as easily been an application from an ISV
available in a registry or something already written and built in-house.

This is really powerful. We will explore using "arbitrary" docker images later.

## Default Project Templates
While it's nice that an administrator can apply a quota and limits to a project,
it would be far nicer if OpenShift could automatically set a default quota and
limits for any project that is created. It can! Here's a link to the
relevant documentation:

    https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/latest/admin_guide/selfprovisioned_projects.html#template-for-new-projects

For your benefit, there is a pre-configured template in the `content` folder
called `default-project-template.yaml`. We'll talk more about templates in a
later lab, so, for now, just do some copy/paste work.

As `root`, first, create/add the template to the default project:

    oc create -f ~/training/content/default-project-template.yaml -n default

Next, edit `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` and find the
`projectConfig` section. You will need to change to match the following line:

    projectRequestTemplate: "default/default-project-request"

Be mindful of spacing with YAML. The `projectRequestMessage` and
`projectRequestTemplate` should be at the same indentation level. Save and exit
your editor, and then restart the master:

    systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master

## Create a Project Via the Template
As `joe`, go ahead and delete your `demo` project. We're going to recreate it in
a moment:

    oc delete project demo

Now, wait a few moments (until the project no longer shows up in the output of
`oc get projects`) and then re-create the `demo` project. This time we will
create the project as the `joe` user (last time the admin did it). 

As `joe`:

    oc new-project demo --display-name="OpenShift 3 Demo" \
    --description="This is the first demo project with OpenShift v3" 

Since it is not disabled, any user can create a project, and that project will
inherit the default project template. This template now has a quota, so if `joe`
does:

    oc get quota
    oc get limitrange

He should see that the project has both a quota and a limit range defined.

## Quota Enforcement
Since we know we can run a pod directly, we'll go through a simple quota
enforcement exercise. The `hello-quota` JSON will attempt to create four
instances of the "hello-openshift" pod. It will fail when it tries to create the
fourth, because the quota on this project limits us to three total pods.

As `joe`, go ahead and use `oc create` and you will see the following:

    oc create -f ~/training/content/hello-quota.json 
    pods/hello-openshift-1
    pods/hello-openshift-2
    pods/hello-openshift-3
    Error from server: Pod "hello-openshift-4" is forbidden: Limited to 3 pods

Let's delete these pods quickly. As `joe` again:

    oc delete pod --all

**Note:** You can delete most resources using "--all" but there is *no sanity
check*. Be careful.
